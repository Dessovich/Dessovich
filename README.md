# Extending the trial period

It is frustrating when there was not enough time for the trial period of the program. We have to buy a license for the program without using the full functionality during the trial period.
I believe that the trial period should be extended without violating the developer's policy.

## Getting Started

Following these instructions, you can extend the trial period of the software.

### Prerequisites

I will be publishing software to reset the trial period for some programs
If you are interested in a certain program that needs to reset the trial period, just write to me about it.
